          <h1> Dupsydim Farms (DF) leverages scale and the design of two-way information systems to learn, innovate and iterate for impact.  </h1>
          <p> At scale, our projects demonstrate improved economies of scale associated with reduced marginal costs. Critically, from a learning perspective, DF’s work at scale gives us access to richer user data which – when complemented by rigorous experimentation and testing – contributes to more efficient learning.   </p>
          <p>We learn and innovate by intentionally drawing on and synthesizing economic theory, empirical evidence, local knowledge and user feedback. By continuously harnessing feedback loops, we progressively iterate and improve the quality and impact of our advisory content, the quality and efficacy of our service delivery, and impact. </p>
          <p>Our research is a global public good which contributes to the knowledge base for all practitioners and researchers active in this sector. We use our findings to improve the quality of our services, as well as to inform the services that our partners offer.</p>
          <p>Wherever possible, we make our learnings and research outputs publicly available to spark further innovation and research in the sector, thereby contributing to the generation of larger aggregate impacts for the poor.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>At every stage of service design and delivery, we generate insights on how to serve our users better, and rigorously test these insights. At scale, these systems allow us to gather large amounts of direct feedback from users in order to continuously improve our performance.</li>
          <li>We conduct A/B testing – comparing two or more service design options to assess which is preferred or more effective – to inform rapid upgrades to our content and service delivery. To date, DF has conducted over 60 A/B tests. Drawing on insights from our program data, external behavioral science evidence, and best practices among peer organizations to design these tests, we are able to iterate improvements for user experience and deliver more appropriate, accessible and customized information. </li>
          <li>We deploy human-centered design practices to continuously improve our understanding of our users, and to design products and interfaces that meet our users where they are – including design for low literacy, technology-constrained, and very low-income users.</li>
          <li>We use experiments and trials to systematically understand impact and feed this information back into our model to refine it over time</li>
          <li>We engage with, learn from, and contribute to leading academic and policy research in the behavioral sciences, economics, and other social sciences.</li>
